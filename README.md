# number-guessing-game
 Developed a Python-based number guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, with hints provided to guide them towards the correct answer. The program tracks the number of attempts and provides feedback until the correct number is guessed. The project demonstrates essential Python skills, including input validation, control structures, and basic use of the random module. Additionally, the game logic is encapsulated within a function, enhancing code modularity and reusability. This project highlights my ability to create interactive and user-friendly Python applications.
